(Generalized) Langton's Ant Automaton.

Langton's ant is a 2D Turing machine.
In this version, at each new x,y location the ant reads the byte value and replaces it w/ another, and chooses a new direction (one of 8 possible directions) to move.

Byte replacement and direction values are read from random arrays.
